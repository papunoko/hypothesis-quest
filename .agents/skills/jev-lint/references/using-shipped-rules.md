# Using the shipped rules

jev-lint ships 54 rules in the npm package's `rules/` directory, one
directory per rule under its language (`rules/typescript/<id>/`,
`rules/rust/<id>/`, …) with `rule.yml`, the `fixtures/` that prove it and
`expect.yml`.
They are the rules to start from: each one has a cutoff fitted to a labelled
corpus, a `state` arm chosen by measurement, and a `criteria` block that took
several rounds to get right. Write your own only for a convention they do not
cover — see [cookbook.md](cookbook.md).

## What ships

**Naming** — does the code do what it calls itself?

| rule | asks | subject | state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fn-name-promises` | does this function's body do what its name promises? | every named function, method, or function-valued binding | `located` |
| `var-name-describes-value` | does this binding's name describe the value bound to it? | `const`/`let` with an initializer that is not a function | `located` |
| `test-name-describes-code` | does this test's code do what its name says? | `it(...)` / `test(...)` calls | `bare` |
| `test-name-verifies-claim` | would this test still pass if the behaviour its name claims were broken? | same | `bare` |
| `module-name-describes-contents` | is this module named for what it contains? | the file, as an outline | `graph` |
| `module-naming-consistent` | do the exports name the same kind of operation with the same words? | the file, as an outline with signatures | `graph` |

**Comments** — is the comment still true?

| rule | asks | subject | state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `comment-describes-declaration` | does the comment above this declaration still hold? | a declaration with a comment directly above it | `located` |
| `comment-describes-block` | does a comment inside a body describe the lines under it? | a statement with a comment directly above it, inside a block; judged with its enclosing function | `bare` |
| `doc-errors-match-body` | does the doc's failure contract (`@throws`, `Raises:`, `# Errors` / `# Panics`) match the body? | a function whose doc comment makes a failure claim | `located` |

**Guarantees** — a name that makes a specific promise

| rule | names | asks | state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `safe-name-is-safe` | `safe*`, `try*`, `*OrNull`, `*OrDefault`, `*OrUndefined` | does a failure the name absorbs still escape as a throw? | `local` |
| `idempotent-name` | `ensure*`, `upsert*`, `setup*`, `install*`, `register*` | does a second call leave a different result from the first? | `located` |
| `pure-name-is-pure` | `compute*`, `calculate*`, `derive*`, `format*`, `to*`, `parse*` | does the body mutate an argument, cache its own result, or read the clock / environment / a random source, even on a fallback path? (`info`) | `local` |

Narrower cousins of `fn-name-promises`, which flags none of their labelled
defects at its own cutoff: a specific promise separates where "does the body
match the name" does not.

**Tests** — tests that cannot verify their name, by construction

| rule | asks | state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-mocks-subject` | is the claimed behaviour performed by a stub, with the assertion reading the stub back? | `located` (the `vi.mock` at the top of the file is the evidence) |
| `snapshot-only-behaviour-claim` | does the title claim a property a whole-render snapshot does not isolate? | `located` |
| `tests-cover-failure-paths` | does this exported function have a failure path (throw, rejection, error result, guard) that none of the file's related tests reaches? | `paired` (excerpts of the related tests; a file with no related test yields no subject and is counted as `unpaired`) |

**Messages** — `log-level-matches-event`: does the level of a
`logger.<level>(...)` call match the severity of the path it sits on?
`local`. `log-message-matches-event`: does its message describe the event
on that path? `local`. `error-message-matches-condition`: does a `throw`'s
message describe the condition the guarding `if` checked? `local`.

**Also**: `type-name-describes-shape` (a type's name against its members,
`located`); `catch-hides-failure` (a `catch` that returns a default or only
logs in a function not named `safe*`/`try*`/`*OrNull`, `local`);
`query-name-describes-sql` (an sqlc `-- name:` against its SQL, the one
`subject: block` rule, `located`); `commit-message-describes-diff` (run by
`jev-lint commits`).

**Config** — `script-name-does`: does a `package.json` script's name
describe the command it runs? JSON, `bare`.

Not asked, deliberately: style, redundancy, whether a comment should exist.
One axis only — is the claim false.

The naming and comment rules each exist under `typescript/` (`TypeScript,
Tsx, JavaScript, Jsx`), `rust/`, `python/` and `go/` where the port
separated, same id, same sentence; `comment-describes-declaration` also
exists under `javascript/`, because JavaScript has no type declarations to
match; `must-name-panics` exists only under `go/`. On a repository with
one language the report prints one line per language it saw no file of —
`no files for python (11 rules), go (9), rust (7)` — and those rules are
idle, not silent. **The `matched nothing` line names only the rules of a
language the run did see**, and that line is the one to check.

The two test rules are nested, not orthogonal: a test that exercises the wrong
case also fails to establish its name, so both fire on that class and only
one fires on a weak assertion.

## How the packs are found

| situation | what is used |
| --- | --- |
| `./rules` exists | `./rules`, and only that |
| no `./rules` | the packs inside the installed package, and jev-lint says so on stdout because their cutoffs were fitted to *its* corpus |
| `-R <path>` (repeatable) | exactly those paths, files or directories |
| `rules: [...]` in `.jev-lint.yaml` | those, unless `-R` is passed |

So the zero-configuration path is: install nothing, run `npx -y jev-lint
check src`, get the packs.

## Three ways to adopt them

### 1. Use them as they are

```bash
npx -y jev-lint check src --dry-run     # count and price first
npx -y jev-lint check src
```

Adjust a cutoff without touching the pack, per run or in the config:

```bash
jev-lint check src --at var-name-describes-value=0.7 --at fn-name-promises=0.8
```

```yaml
# .jev-lint.yaml
at:
  var-name-describes-value: 0.7
  fn-name-promises: 0.8
```

`at:` in the config merges: overriding one rule leaves the others at their
shipped values. This is the right first move when a rule is noisy on your
code — the shipped cutoff sits where the corpus's clean band ended, and real
code's clean band goes higher. `var-name-describes-value` and
`module-name-describes-contents` are the two with the least headroom and the
first to refit.

### 2. Copy them and edit

```bash
mkdir -p rules
cp -R node_modules/jev-lint/rules/fn-name-promises rules/   # one rule, with its evals; or all of them
```

Now `./rules` exists and the packaged copies are ignored entirely. Delete the
rules you do not want, change `severity:`, rewrite `criteria:` for your
domain, add `note:` with your exceptions. Two things to know before editing:

- **Editing `ask`, `criteria`, `note`, `rule`, `subject` or `state`
  invalidates that rule's cached verdicts** — it is a new question. Editing
  `at` or `severity` invalidates nothing. Recalibration is free by design.
- **A rule in two languages is two files with one id** (`rules/typescript/<id>`,
  `rules/rust/<id>`). The sentence is a copy; the loader warns when the copies
  drift, so edit both.

Dropping a language variant is a deletion, not a `languages:` edit: the Rust
rule names Rust node kinds, and ast-grep rejects a kind absent from the target
grammar — one rejected rule fails the whole scan.

### 3. Combine with your own

```bash
jev-lint check src -R node_modules/jev-lint/rules -R rules/mine.yml
```

```yaml
# .jev-lint.yaml
rules:
  - node_modules/jev-lint/rules
  - rules/mine.yml
```

Ids must be unique across every source; a duplicate is a validation error
naming both files. Prefix your own (`acme-...`) to make the split visible in
reports.

## Picking a subset

There is no per-rule enable flag. Pick directories:

```bash
jev-lint check src -R node_modules/jev-lint/rules/fn-name-promises -R node_modules/jev-lint/rules/test-name-verifies-claim
```

or copy (way 2) and delete. To silence a rule in one file without changing
the rules, use a suppression comment:

```ts
// jev-lint-ignore-file comment-describes-block
```

## What the shipped cutoffs are worth

Fitted on each rule's own fixtures (`rules/<lang>/<id>/`, 401 labelled defects
across the 54 rules, three passes each). 47 of the 54 reach precision and
recall 1.00 at their shipped cutoffs; the seven that do not each miss one
labelled defect the rule file names — a binding holding one branch of a
union result, a Rust field taken under another field's name, an inline
comment that is only false together with the loop after it, and their
Python and Go cousins. Read all of it
as "separates the classes in a small set of cases", not as a guarantee. The
cases are marker-free; the fits produced while `// DEFECT` lines sat above
each defect were better than the rules.

The four newer packs were also run once over an unseen repository of 1,391
subjects before shipping; their findings there are in the pack headers.

On unseen code expect the clean band to be higher than the corpus's. That is
the documented procedure, not a caveat: run, read the findings, and refit the
two or three rules that produced false positives with
[calibration.md](calibration.md).

## In CI

```yaml
- run: npx -y jev-lint review --base "origin/${{ github.base_ref }}" --format github
  env:
    TYPESAFE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TYPESAFE_API_KEY }}
```

Review mode judges only the lines the diff touched. Commit
`.jev-lint-cache.json` if you want reviewers to see the verdicts you saw and
CI to re-gate without a key; treat it as trusted input in review, since
anything that edits it can silence a rule.

Locally, `jev-lint init --pre-commit` writes a hook that runs
`review --staged --fail-on error` on every commit: the staged diff only,
every finding printed, the commit blocked only by a rule at `severity:
error`. If a hook already exists (husky, a task runner), it prints the one
line to add instead of overwriting.
